"""
Topological sort is implementation of linear order
 in which to put on the items(tasks and etc)
 The Graph show dependencies between different tasks
 The graph should be acyclic and directed (DAG)
Terms:
- The number of edges entering a vertex is the *vertexâ€™s in-degree*
- DAG must have at least one vertex with in-degree 0 and at least
   one vertex with outdegree 0 (no edges leaving the vertex),
   for otherwise there would be a cycle
Complexity: O(n+m)
